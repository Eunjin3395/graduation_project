It was delicious. It was good because there was a lot of oysters compared to 11,000 won. Looking at the amount of oysters alone, I don't think it's comparable to other places. However, it was a shame that the oysters were not very fresh. Maybe that's why, the taste of the soup was murky. But it was delicious, and even though it's white broth, it's a spicy taste that reminds you of course. Oh, parking is not enough space, so you have to go to the nearby villa."

Since it's handmade noodles, the thickness is not constant, but it's very chewy. Jajangmyeon and jjamppong were all good.
