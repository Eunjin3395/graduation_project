Among them, I visited the famous Sol-Sot Seongsu store. I came in well and prepared myself for the waiting, but as of 12:30 on Friday, there were 8 waiting teams.

398,service,"일욜에 방문하고 테이블링 웨이팅 접수하는데 메뉴까지 선정하라고 함. 일행 안와서 메뉴부터 정하는 시스템이라 벌써 맘안듦. 1시간 정도 기다리고 들어왔고 음식 한 10분 후에 나옴. 반찬 다 마르게 나오길래 직원한테 바꿔달라고 했는데 반찬 미리 담아놓은 거라 괜찮다고 하심ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 먹기 전에 이미 기분이 나빠짐.
솥밥인데 밥이 뜨거운 느낌이 없고 데워서 준 것처럼 나옴. 그냥 솥밥 아닌 미지근한 밥을 줌.
먹다가 밑반찬 떨어지는데 벨도 없고, 직원 3명 구석쪽 모여서 폰하고 얘기하는거 보니 부르려다 말았음. 그냥 빨리 먹고 나가기로 함. 
결론적으로, 서비스는 별로인 듯. 여자 직원분 머리 묶지 않고 푼 채로 모자쓰고 일함. 뭐 좀 요청하려는데 직원 부르기가 힘듦. 사장님 서비스 신경 많이 쓰셔야 할 듯!","I visit on Sunday and receive tabling waiting, but I'm also told to select a menu. I don't like it already because it's a system where I choose the menu first because my company didn't come. I waited for about an hour and came back, and the food came out in about 10 minutes later. The side dishes came out dry, so I asked the staff to change them, but they said it was okay because they put the side dishes in advance, but I already felt bad before I ate them.. It's a pot rice, but the rice doesn't feel hot, and it looks like it's been heated. It's not just hot pot rice, but lukewarm rice.. I was going to call you when I was eating side dishes, but there was no bell, and I saw three employees gathered in the corner talking to their phones. I just decided to eat quickly and go out. In conclusion, the service is not good. A female employee works with a hat on without tying her hair. I'm trying to ask for something, but it's hard to call an employee. I think the boss needs to pay a lot of attention to the service!"

Wait a minute. You must add fried shrimp as a side menu.. I don't regret it If I regret it, I regret ordering more fried shrimp.. It's the top 1 fried shrimp in my 22 years of life. Overall, there was a lot and I put nurungji in the pot at the end, but I ate it in a hurry without thinking about taking a picture.. The staff were so kind that I had a great meal.
