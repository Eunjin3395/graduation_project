0,taste,특수부위 아주 맛있어요! 보기에는 고기가 두툼해서 질길것 같은데 정말 부드럽고 살살 녹아요~ 완전 반전!! ㅋㅋㅋ 된장찌개도 진짜 맛있고 파절이에 김치들까지 같이 싸서 먹으면 말이 필요없죠! 연기도 잘 빠지게 해놔서 불편함 없이 고기 즐길 수 있어요! 굿~,"Special parts are very delicious! The meat looks thick and tough, but it melts really soft and softly A total twist!! Doenjang jjigae is really good and there's no need for words if you wrap it with seasoned scallions and kimchi! The smoke escapes easily, so you can enjoy the meat without any inconvenience! Good"

8,taste,"결과부터 말하자만 너무 기대가 컸던 탓인지 다시는 가고 싶지 않을 정도로 불쾌했다. 유선 상으로 문의할 때부터 아주머니의 쌀쌀 맞은 태도는 불쾌하기엔 충분했는데 도착 후 테이블 응대는 바쁘다는 말을 흘리며 한참 동안이나 주문을 받아주지 않았다. 하지만 음식이 맛있다면 모든게 상쇄될거라 생각했는데 그 역시 착각이었다. 음식 맛은 그저 그랬고, 서버의 응대도 그닥.. 이렇게 바쁘다면 최소한 손님을 제한하며 받든가 서버를 더 고용해야 하지 않을까.. 이런 리뷰를 남겨도 갈 사람은 갈테지만 누군가 이 곳을 방문하려 할 때 한 번 쯤이나마 고민해봤으면 하는 마음에 리뷰를 남긴다.","Let me tell you the results first, but I was so unpleasant that I didn't want to go again, maybe because I had high expectations. From the time I inquired on the wire, the lady's chilly attitude was enough to be unpleasant, but after arriving, she did not accept the order for a long time, saying that she was busy responding to the table. But I thought everything would be offset if the food was delicious, but he was also mistaken. The taste of the food was okay, and the response of the server was not good.. If you're this busy, shouldn't you at least limit the number of customers or hire more servers.. Even if you leave a review like this, you will go, but I leave a review in the hope that you will think about it at least once when someone tries to visit this place."
9,taste,"알바 하시는분 저에게 다가와 웃으면서 2틀밖에 안되었으니 잘모르겠다고 하셨고 마치 난 모르니 너가 알아서 해라 느낌이었구요 그건 다 이해할수 있었습니다 음식점은 특히 고깃집은 고기가 생명인대 가격에 비해 많이 아쉬웠습니다
육회는 35000인대 정말 소비자에게 팔지 않으셔야 할것 같구요 그래도 냉면은 물냉 비냉 맛있게 먹었습니다 ","The part-timer came up to me and smiled and said, ""I don't know because it's only been two days, so I don't know, so I felt like you should do it on your own."" I could understand that Restaurants, especially meat restaurants, were very disappointing compared to the price of meat. Beef tartare costs 35,000 won. I don't think you should sell it to consumers But I still enjoyed the cold noodles with water and spicy noodles"
10,taste,"예약하고 갔는데 준비도 잘 해주셔서 좋았어용
고기 맛은 물론 기본 찬들도 너무 만족스럽고 맛있었어요 사진에는 없지만 냉면이 찐맛이에요ㅠㅠㅜ","I made a reservation and it was good because they prepared it well. The basic dishes as well as the taste of the meat were very satisfying and delicious It's not in the picture, but the naengmyeon is really goodㅜㅠㅠ"

15,taste,저녁 9인 예약하고 8인이 방문했습니다. 3/3/3 자리 셋팅으로 한명이 오지않아 한 자리를 안 쓰겠다고 했습니다. 주인인지 여직원분이 룸예약은 45만원치를 먹거나 미달시 5만원 차지라고 퉁명스러운 대답. 알겠다고 했습니다. 일행이 그릇을 문의 하니 저기 셋팅 되어있다고 퉁명스러운 대답에 죄송하다고 했습니다. 근데 네이버에는 30만원치 식사 미만시 3만원 차지.. 뭐가 불만이셔서 가격을 더 높게 부르시고 그렇게 퉁명스럽게 대하셨을까요? 식사는 40만원 넘게 먹고 왔습니다. 고기 맛있고 유명한 집은 손님을 이렇게 대우해도 되나봅니다. 고기도 맛있고 친절해서 가끔 방문했는데 더 이상 그렇지 않은 것 같네요. 다음 방문은 이제 모르겠습니다. ,"I made a reservation for 9 people in the evening and 8 people visited. I said I wouldn't use one seat because one person didn't come due to the 3/3/3 digit setting. A female employee who is the owner of the room said, ""If you eat 450,000 won worth of room reservations or fail to make it, you will get 50,000 won."" I said yes. When the group inquired about the bowl, they said they were sorry for the blunt answer that it was set over there. But on Naver, if you eat less than 300,000 won, you charge 30,000 won.. What's so frustrating that you're asking for a higher price and being so blunt  I ate more than 400,000 won. I guess this is how a famous restaurant with delicious meat treats customers. The meat was delicious and kind, so I visited it sometimes, but it doesn't seem like it anymore. I don't know about the next visit."
16,taste,고기 맛있네요. 대화하면서 먹기 좋은 곳이예요 :),The meat is good. It's a good place to eat while talking :)

38,taste,정말 맛있는 돼지고기를 파는 성수의 몽련. 정말 맛집이다. 역시 핫플레이스인데는 항상 이유가 있다. 일일한정메뉴인 도끼살은 시그니쳐일만 하다. 스테이크처럼 두껍고 지방도 별로 없어보임에도 엄청나게 부드러운 식감을 자랑한다. 숄더렉이 이렇게 맛있는 부위였나? 몇몇 조각에 붙어있는 지방 또한 도끼살의 매력 중 하나다. 서비스로 나오는 찌게는 또 왜이렇게 맛있는지 모르겠다. 고기도 들어가있는데 이걸 공짜로 먹어도 되는건가 싶을 정도. 몽련의 또다른 강점중 하나는 후식이다. 비냉은 7천원으로 후식 치곤 살짝 비싼감이 있지만 이 또한 한입 먹으면 곧바로 돈생각은 커녕 구냥 행복하게 먹게된다. 청어알 볶음밥은 피날레로 장식하기에 부족함이 없었다. 이보다 완벽한 저녁식사를 할 수 있는 곳 찾기 쉽지 않을듯.,"Seongsu's Mongryeon selling really delicious pork. It's a really good restaurant. There's always a reason why it's a hot place. Axsal, a daily limited menu, is worth a signature. It looks thick and fatless like steak, but it boasts an incredibly soft texture. Perhaps the shoulder rack is such a delicious part, but the fat attached to some pieces is also one of the charms of axe meat. I don't know why the free stew is so delicious. There's meat in it, so I wonder if I can eat this for free. Another strength of Mongryeon is dessert. Binaeng is 7,000 won, which feels a little expensive for dessert, but if you take a bite of it, you can eat it happily, let alone think of money. The herring roe fried rice was enough to decorate with a finale. It won't be easy to find a place to have a more perfect dinner."
39,taste,떡볶이 맛집,Tteokbokki place

46,taste,고기는 맛있었어요. 6시 넘어서 가도 도끼살 있어서 그 부분은 안심하셔도 돼요. 근데 2층 3~4인석은 룸이 아니어서 매우 춥습니다. 오죽하면 고기만 먹고 밥도 못먹고 나왔겠어요.. 그러니 4인 이하의 사람들은 웬만하면 시끄럽고 코로나가 걱정되더라도 1층으로 예약하세요. ,"The meat was delicious. You don't have to worry about that part even if you go past 6 o'clock because there's ax meat. But the seats for three to four people on the second floor are not rooms, so it's very cold. You must have eaten only meat and couldn't eat.. So if you have less than 4 people, make a reservation on the first floor even if it's noisy and you're worried about Corona."
47,taste,맛릿음 차돌된장 굿,"Delicious beef brisket doenjang, good"
48,taste,"- 가족 생일파티 장소로 미리 예약하고 방문했어요! 3명이라 룸은 못 잡았고 2층 테이블에서 먹었는데 좌석이 그렇게 많지 않아서 막 시끄럽거나 그러지 않아서 좋았어요.
- 몽련도끼살+오겹살+두항정살+청어알볶음밥 주문했고 전체적인 총평부터 말하자면 몽련도끼살보다는 오겹살과 항정살이 존맛입니다. 도끼살 먼저 먹고 오겹살 항정살을 나중에 더 시켰는데 처음부터 이거 시킬걸 후회했어요ㅠㅋㅋㅋ 도끼살은 특이하다는거 빼고는 살짝 질긴 부위도 있고 양이 너무 적어서 기대한것보다는 그저 그랬어요ㅠ 뼈 무게 빼면 양이 너무 적어요. 
그리고 청어알볶음밥 강추..! 무슨 맛이다 설명은 잘 못하겠지만 처음 먹어보는 맛이었고 볶음밥치고 6천원이면 좀 비싸지만 되게 고급진 맛이었어요. 서비스로 나오는 차돌된장찌개도 굿굿","- I made a reservation for my family's birthday party in advance and visited! I couldn't get a room because there were 3 people, and I ate at the table on the 2nd floor, but there weren't many seats, so it was good because it wasn't noisy.. - We ordered Mongryeon axe + pork belly + tofu pork belly + herring roe fried rice, and the overall review is that pork belly and pork neck are more delicious than Mongryeon axe. I ate ax meat first and ordered pork belly meat later, but I regretted ordering this from the beginningExcept that the ax meat is unique, there are some tough parts, and the amount was too small, so it was less than I expected. If you take out the weight of the bone, the amount is too small. And I strongly recommend the herring roe fried rice! I can't explain what it tastes like, but it was my first time eating it, and 6,000 won was a bit expensive for fried rice, but it was very luxurious. Beef brisket doenjang jjigae is also good"
49,taste,고기맛은 무난하나 서비스가 너무 불친절함. 밥도 몇번을 얘기해야 갖다주고 리필해달라고 하면 기분나쁘게 째려봄. 소스좀 달라고 했더니 말도 안하고 안먹는거 뿌려주고는 가버림. ,"The taste of the meat is easy, but the service is too unfriendly. I have to tell him how many times to bring me food and when he asks for a refill, he glares at me in a bad mood. I asked for some sauce, but he didn't say anything and left."

55,taste,메뉴 하나 하나 다 맛있었어요?? 근데 맥주랑 막걸리는 굳이 통벌집으로 안시켜도 될 거 같음,Each and every menu was delicious?? But I don't think we need to order beer and makgeolli at a beehive

82,taste,예약한 룸 보다 좋은 곳으로 바꿔주시는 친절함에 감사드립니다. 직원의 친절도 또한 너무 좋아서 동반자들의 만족도가 최고였습니다. 다만 육회는 좀 맛이 떨어지는 듯 합니다. 너무 감사드립니다,"Thank you for your kindness in changing to a better place than the reserved room.

육회도 맛있어서 네 접시나 비웠습니다. 육사시미도 썰어서 내어주셨는데요. 당일 도축한 신선한 고기 최고였습니다! 다음 회식 때도 몽련에 올 것 같네요! ","I made a reservation because I wanted to buy delicious meat for the staff. The group seats were separated from the hall, so it was private and the service was excellent. Axe meat and pork belly are both popular, so I ate a lot^^*.

And how many times did I say that our food hasn't come out yet..

If the heater breaks down, you can buy one.. There are many places that grill pork in Seongsu-dong. It's not even that here.. Even on weekends, there are almost no servers.. They didn't call the staff because they thought there would be no customers. Then, I recommend that you receive as many customers as the number of employees.. Side dishes are okay. The meat was just so.. I live in Seongsu-dong, but I don't think I'll revisit"
164,taste,음식이 맛있고 서비스가 좋았습니다,The food was delicious and the service was good
165,taste,"우선 손님이 많아서 그런지 직원분들이 정신이 없어 보였어요. 그래서!! 서비스는 별로 입니다!! 

도끼살보다는 목살이 더 맛이 있었어요.
한번쯤 먹을만하지만 찾아서 먹고 싶을 정도는 아닌거 같아요. 개인적으로 목살을 추천해요.
된장찌개, 볶음밥 맛 있어서 된장찌개는 두번 시켜 먹었어요. 간도 적당했어요","First of all, the staff seemed to be busy because there were many customers. So!! The service is not good!! . Pork neck was more delicious than axe meat.. It's worth eating once, but I don't think it's enough to find it and want to eat it. Personally, I recommend pork neck.. Doenjang stew and fried rice were delicious, so I ordered doenjang stew twice. The seasoning was just right"

168,taste,"1시에 예약 가능한지 문의했으나 답변이 없으셔서 2시에 예약하고 방문했는데 자리가 많았어요. 매장이 생각보다 너무 추웠고, 3시부터 break time 이라고 반드시 나가야 된다고 이야기 하셔서 너무 빨리 먹는 바람에 제가 고기를 먹은건지... 불편했어요. 고기는 괜찮았지만 고기보단 차돌된장이 더 맛있었고, 시그니처 통벌꿀맥주는 이물질이 있어 마시기 불편했어요. ","I asked if I could make a reservation at 1 o'clock, but there was no answer, so I made a reservation at 2 o'clock and visited, but there were many seats. The store was colder than I thought, and they told me that I had to go out for break time from 3 o'clock, so I think I ate meat because I ate it too fast... It was uncomfortable. The meat was okay, but the beef brisket soybean paste was better than the meat, and the signature honey beer was uncomfortable to drink because it had foreign substances."

I ate meat deliciously and ordered fried rice at the end, but my friend and I asked if I could add more rice. I ordered fried rice because I wanted to eat rice again, but I said it was salty enough to need a spoonful of rice, but I didn't know you would respond like that..It was ridiculous. It's not because I don't have money, but the customers' tastes may be wrong, but the fried rice I ordered is salty and I asked for more rice, but I couldn't get cut off. I looked at other customers with that expression. It was so embarrassing. It felt dirty in the sky while eating happily  I don't think I'll ever go again"

홀에 인원이 더 있었으면 합니다.","The meat is good. It's a shame that the ax meat is sold out even though it's 6 o'clock.

187,taste,맛있습니다. 도끼살이 여기 시그니처 메뉴인데 지금껏 4번정도 간거 같네요. 포인트는 너무 익히지 말고 살짝 덜 익혀야 육즙이 살아있고 맛있습니다. 처음 먹었을때의 그 느낌을 잊을수 없네요 ㅎ 육즙 살아잇는 돼지고기는 처음이였음 ㅋ 근데 두세번 넘어가니 처음의 그 감흥까지는 없지만 그래도 맛있습니다. 고기 먹을때 항상 냉면을 시키는데 여기 냉면은 살짝 면이 항상 뿔어 잇어서 좀 별로이긴합니다만. 아무래도 바빠서 면을 지체시키다보니 그런듯. 그래도 항상 면을 시키긴하네요. 암튼 맛있습니다.,"It's delicious. This is the signature dish, and I think I've been there about four times. The point is that it's not overcooked, but slightly undercooked to make the meat juicy and delicious. I can't forget how I felt when I first ate it It was my first time eating pork with juicy meat. But after two or three times, I didn't get the first impression, but it was still delicious. I always order naengmyeon when I eat meat, but this naengmyeon isn't good because it's always a bit thick. I think it's because I'm busy and I'm holding up my noodles. But I always order noodles. Anyway, it's delicious."

When I first visited, the service was full. Since I fell in love with ax meat. There were empty seats until I finished eating and came out. I'm going to eat more of the ax meat because it's delicious. The beef brisket doenjang jjigae was too salty, so I poured 3 cups of water and also the fried rice I fell in love with. Just salty memories rather than taste. Even if you order glass wine, Hamheungchacha Only the person who brought the ax meat. He's kind.

The fire was so strong that I burned some meat, but it was good because it was big and juicy. Suran herring roe fried rice is good, good!

","There weren't many customers at lunch on Sunday. I ate pork belly and pork neck, and I was disappointed that pork belly was 70% fat, but it was not bad to eat it with pork belly without fat.

It is also registered as a franchise store on the Zero Pay app.It also appears on Naver map as a Zero Pay franchise..

365,taste,"준비된 고기의 맛은 그저그런데, 가격은 절대 고기의 품질에 비해 비쌉니다. 청담동에서 이가격대 고기를 먹으면 맛은 물론 서비스도 친절한데, 몽련은 바쁘고 종업원이 부족하다는 핑계로 불러도 잘 오지않고, 추가 오더에 대하여 서빙을 할때도 화가난듯이 테이블에 던지고 가는 식이라서 혹시 무슨일 있냐고했더니 바뻐서 그런다고 이해하라는 식이였습니다. 같이 간 일행들도 기분 나뻐하는 바람에 제가 이런곳에 예약해서 미안하다고 하고 대충 저녁식사하고 나왔습니다. 앞으로 다시는 가지말아야할 리스트에 올렸습니다. 맛도, 가격도, 서비스도 만족스럽지 않은 저녁식사 자리였습니다.","The taste of the prepared meat is simple, but the price is expensive compared to the quality of the absolute meat. If you eat meat at this price in Cheongdam-dong, the taste and service are kind, but Mongryeon doesn't come well even if you call it under the excuse of being busy and not enough employees, and when you serve additional orders, you throw it on the table as if you were angry, so you should understand it because you were busy. The people I went with were also upset, so I apologized for making a reservation here and had a rough dinner. I put it on the list that I should never go again. It was a dinner party where I was not satisfied with the taste, the price, and the service."

In addition, they gave me a reservation seat by the window at 5 o'clock, but I arrived 15 minutes early (correctly because I called), so I asked the staff to take a break, so I was wondering if the reservation for 5 o'clock should be 2 or 3 minutes late... The part where I told him to come 2 or 3 minutes late was weird I know the break time and it's so cold. I'm asking you to come late next time.. Seongsu is not famous for meat... If you are looking for a good meat restaurant, I think it would be better to go near Wangsimni.. It's my first time giving such a low rating..."

감사합니다","I took my parents and I was very satisfied. Axe meat was good and cold noodles and fried rice were also delicious There was a terrace, so the view was great and the atmosphere was great However, the parking lot is small, so I used the underground parking lot of the front building, but it's worth considering I have a doctor to visit again next time.

397,taste,"웬만하면 그냥 먹는데 진짜 비추에요.

1. 맛이없다. 가격값 절대 못합니다.
    도끼살, 항정살, 목살, 뒷덜미살 먹었습니다.
    이 돈으로 딴 거 먹는게 낫고, 항정살
    뒷덜미살은 진짜 최악입니다.  제대로 썰지도 
    않아서 다 붙어있습니다.
    전반적으로 고무줄같이 질기고 뭔맛인지
    모르겠습니다. 근처 금돼지나 땅코랑 정말 
    비교 됩니다. 

2. 위생. 요즘 시대에 큐알체크도 안해서 좀 
    당황했습니다. 역시나 고기에 머리카락 붙여
    서 가져다 주셨는데, 미안하다는 말도 없어요

3. 서비스. 친절하다 그래서 갔는데, 사람이 
    바뀐건지, 초심을 잃은 건지 기본도 못해요.
    굽는 것도 셀프고 갈 이유가 없네요. 

분위기때문에 기대했다가 잡쳤어요","I just eat it, but I really don't show it... 1. It doesn't taste good. I can't afford the price at all..     I ate axe meat, pork neck meat, and back meat..     It's better to eat something else with this money, pork neck. The backside is the worst.  I didn't cut it properly, so it's all stuck together..     Overall, it's tough like a rubber band and what it tastes like.     I don't know. Compared to the golden pig or the dank nose. 2. Hygiene. I'm a little flustered because I don't even check QR these days. Stick your hair on the meat.     They brought it to me, but they didn't say sorry. . 3. Service. I heard it was kind, so I went there.     I don't know if it's changed or lost its original intention..     There's no reason to grill it myself. I was expecting it because of the atmosphere, but I got caught"

The atmosphere was good, of course it was delicious, and the party was a little late due to an urgent situation, but they were kind until the end, so I ate happily.

고기 도끼살 그저그럼 삼겹살이 더 맛있음.
맛있는 맛집인줄 알고 갔는데 그저그럼. 소문난 잔치상에 먹을게 없다는 말이 맞음. 그리고 직원들 미숙함.","Wow... It's very noisy whether you eat with your nose or mouth. The table is too small for meat and the grill is half-hearted. If a customer notices and says it's noisy, there are other customers at the next table, so I don't have the sense to ask them to be quiet.. Meat ax meat is more delicious then pork belly.. I thought it was a good restaurant, so I went. It is true that there is nothing to eat at the famous feast. And staff inexperience."

417,taste,"2층 자리 조용하고 좋았습니다.
소고기보다 돼지고기가 맛있었고 찍어먹는 소스? 젓갈이 매콤하니 좋았어요.
다만 고기 구워주는 서비스가 전혀 없었고 다른 고기 전문 식당에 비해서 알바생들이 능숙하지가 않았습니다. ","The seat on the second floor was quiet and nice.. Pork was more delicious than beef, and I liked the spicy salted seafood with sauce.. However, there was no meat-grilling service at all, and the part-timers were less skilled than other meat restaurants."

421,taste,"고기도 맛있고 직원들도 친절하다 그래서 기대하고 갔는데.. 여러모로 실망이었습니다. 가격에 비해서 직원들의 케어가 거의 없었고 도끼살의 경우 큰 기대에 비해 그저그런 맛이었네요.. 차돌된장은 먹을 만 했습니다. 추가로 시킨 제주돼지3종세트에선 머리카락이 나와 바로 물렸고 다시 새로 나온 고기의 커팅 상태도 그닥 좋아보이지 않았습니다. 목살은 그나마 먹을만했고 항정살 뒷덜미살은.. 도대체 뭘 먹는지 모르겠는 맛이었습니다. 처음 들어가는 숯은 딱 도끼살 하나 먹을정도의 양인데 추가주문을 하면 숯이라도 더 넣어주던지 해야할텐데.. 판도 알아서 안갈아주고,  계속 직원 부르기도 뻘줌하고.. 여러모로 아쉬웠습니다.","The meat was delicious and the staff were kind, so I went looking forward to it.. It was disappointing in many ways. Compared to the price, there was little care from the staff, and the ax meat tasted just like that compared to the big expectations.. Beef brisket doenjang was good to eat. In the 3 additional sets of Jeju pigs ordered, hair came out and was bitten right away, and the cutting condition of the new meat did not look very good. Pork neck was more than enough to eat, and the back of the pork neck was.. It tasted like I didn't know what I was eating. The first charcoal is enough to eat just one axe, but if I order more, I should add more charcoal.. I didn't change the board on my own, and I was embarrassed to keep calling the staff.. I was disappointed in many ways."

차돌된장찌개에서 청국장 맛이 살짝 느껴져서 맛이 한층 깊은게 좋았고 마지막에 볶음밥까지 먹었는데 넷이서 대짜 시켰음에도 불구하고 조금 부족한 느낌이었어요ㅠㅠ 고기도 추가추가로 많이 먹었는데도 배가 조금 덜차더라구요
하지만 인테리어 깔끔하고 조용한 분위기와 천장에 투명 창문이 있어서 햇살과 나뭇잎 그림자가 드리워지는게 운치있어 한참을 쳐다봤습니다^^
아기의자는 생각지도 못했는데 여러개 구비가 되있더라구요! 유레카~ 이런데 어떻게 찾았냐고 다들 만족스러워 하던데 워낙에 핫플에 후기가 좋아서 선택한 것 뿐인데 완벽했네요ㅋㅋㅋㅋ","I went to the open time early and enjoyed the meat. The only picture I have is Doksal, the signature menu of Mongryeon. Axe meat was good and the Jeju pork belly and pork belly that I ordered were softHaha. I liked the deep taste of cheonggukjang in beef brisket doenjang jjigae, and I even ate fried rice at the end, but it felt a little lacking even though the four of us ordered itI ate a lot of extra meat, but I was a little less full. However, I looked at the interior for a long time because it had a clean and quiet atmosphere and a transparent window on the ceiling, so I could see the sunlight and the shadow of the leaves^^. I didn't think of a baby chair, but there were several! Eureka! Everyone was satisfied with how I found it. I just chose it because I liked the reviews on the hot place, but it was perfect[Laughing]"

Since it's a set, I asked the general public to explain the meat that comes out in various parts because they don't know which part, but they just pretend they didn't hear it. I think three employees, including the owner, are out of control at all.The smoke is thick and the store is dark and I can't eat with a big bang. Busy concentrating on burning meat lol. Furthermore, I ordered several cold noodles because there were many people. Two of the plates came out as if the noodles were lukewarm, so I told the boss directly, ""Can I add one more?"" and put two ice on the naengmyeon that came out as if you want me to see. (There was no ice in the other naengmyeon that came out. I think it means to eat without saying anything since it went this far). For Instagram sentiment, it's a good place to go..."

If you order axe meat, it comes out like beef brisket doenjang jjigae. The doenjang jjigae is really good too. Everything I ate was good.

508,taste,"이번 방문전에 4번 갓엇습니다. 매번 서비스도 좋고, 맛도있고 고기 퀄리티도 높다고 생각했었는데 이번방문은 정말 실망했습니다. 그사이 인기가 많아졌는데 초심을 잃으신듯합니다. 알바분들 불친절하구요 예전엔 고기 굽는거 케어해주셨는데 케어는 커녕 불러도 안오구요. 도끼살 커팅도 예전과는 다르게 대충대충 가위가는대로 잘라주고 소고기 돼지고기 할것없이 육즙이 감소하고
질겨졌고 후식은 전체적으로 단맛이 강해지고 텁텁한게 msg를 더 많이 쓰는거같습니다.  처음갓을때의 감동은 아무데서도 느낄수 없었네요. 집앞이라 정말 애정하던 곳인데 다시는 안갈겁니다.","I went four times before this visit. I always thought the service was good, the taste was good, and the quality of the meat was high, but this visit was really disappointing. In the meantime, you've become more popular, but you seem to have lost your original intention. The part-timers are unkind. They used to take care of me grilling meat, but they don't come even if I call them. Unlike before, the axe meat is cut roughly according to the scissors, and the juice decreases regardless of beef and pork. It's tough, and the dessert overall has a stronger sweetness, and I think I use msg more when it's dry.  I couldn't feel the emotion when I first started. It's a place I really loved because it's in front of my house, but I'm never going to go again."
509,taste,도끼살이 정말 맛있어요~!,The ax meat is really good!
510,taste,불친절하다는 평이 많아서 걱정했는데 괜찮았고요 음식도 엄청 맛있었어요  연기가 하두 많이 나서 그건 좀 불편했는데 그건 구조상 어쩔 수 없는 듯ㅠ  여튼 맛있고 좋았습니다. 또 갈 거 같아요~,"I was worried because a lot of people said I was unfriendly, but it was okay. The food was really good  It was a little uncomfortable because there was a lot of smoke, but it was inevitable because of the structure. Anyway, it was delicious and good. I think I'm going to go again"
511,taste,점심 먹으러 갔어요. 찌개가 아주 특별하게 맛있는건 아니었지만 반찬 구성이 잘나오네요.,"I went to have lunch. The stew wasn't particularly delicious, but the side dishes come out well."

어쨌든 맛은 있어요","I've been there a few times before, so the taste is really good. Maybe it's good, but the people answering the phone are a little unfriendly. When it first opened, everyone was very kind, but I feel bitter that it's changing. Anyway, it's delicious"
514,taste,넘 맛있는데 고기 양이 적어요ㅠ 육회도 괜찮아요. 근데 마늘 싫어하는데 육회에 마늘이 넘 많이 들어서 다음엔 안시키랴고요. 제주도가서 너무 맛있어서 충격받았던 흑돼지만큼 맛있어요,"It's so good, but the amount of meat is small. Beef tartare is good, too. I don't like garlic, but there's too much garlic in raw beef, so I'm not going to order it next time. It's as good as the black pork that I was shocked at because it was so good in Jeju Island"

그 부분이 아쉬워서 별 두개 뺐어요. 
음식은 맛있어요. ","The food was delicious. The ventilator is not working, so there's a lot of smoke inside. I opened the folding door slightly and tried to ventilate. .

초창기에 비해 반찬 종류 및 퀄이 떨어졌고, 숯으로 만 구워서 고기가 잘 안구어짐.

There were a lot of pickled vegetables wrapped in meat and a special pepper sauce was served, but it was spicy, but I kept wanting to eat it. And the pickled flower-shaped onion was also a great move. The visuals and taste are the best! People who help with serving also praise me and most of all the restrooms are really clean :).

직원분들 서비스도 고기집 특성을 생각하면 나쁘지 않았습니다~ 적당한 느낌이었어요 ㅎㅎ
한가지 아쉬운 점은 네이버 예약 시, 제공된다는 서비스는 제공받지 못하였네요^^;; 깜빡하고 못챙기신거 같습니다. 사실 해당 예약할때는 이벤트를 몰랐는데 메뉴판에 적혀있어서 알았어요;; 저희가 먼저 요청할 수도 있었지만 서비스 개념이다보니 따로 요청드리지는 않고 퇴점하면서 사장님께만 말씀드렸습니다.
맛있게 잘 먹었습니다~","The meat and basic side dishes were delicious, and the fried rice and cold noodles were also very delicious. Herb seasoning axe meat (shoulder rack), soft and chewy pork belly, and moist pork belly are all delicious!! Various sauces were the best, too I reserved a seat for 6 people, but they prepared two tables for 4 people, so I ate it comfortably!! The service of the staff wasn't bad considering the characteristics of the meat restaurant It felt just right Haha. One thing I'm sorry about is that I didn't get a service that was provided when I made a reservation on Naver^^;; I think you forgot to bring it. Actually, I didn't know the event when I made the reservation, but I knew because it was written on the menu;; we could have requested it first, but since it was a service concept, I didn't request it separately, but I only told the boss when I left the store.. I ate it deliciously"
624,taste," 예약을 하고 가서 그런지 우리자리는 상차림이을
너무 오래전에 해놨나봐요.
모든 밑반찬이 말라져 있었고 주문응대가 
넘 느렸어요.
문도 계속 열려 있어서 너무 추웠고 바람이 어디서 들어오는지 닫혀있어도 추웠네요..
하지만 고기맛은 좋았아요..
주말이나 바쁢땐 직원을 더 많이 두셔야 할것같네요~","Maybe it's because we made a reservation, but our seats are all set. I think I set it up too long ago.. All the side dishes were dried up and the order response was too slow.. The door was always open, so it was very cold, and it was cold even though it was closed where the wind came from... But the meat tasted good... I think you should have more employees on weekends or when you're busyYou~"

626,taste,몽련도끼살은 그동안 먹어본 고기 중에 최고의 육즙이였어요~~특히 차돌박이 된장찌개는 입맛이 짧은 남친을 만족시켰고 청어알 알밥은 고소하고 배가 부르는데도 계속 먹고싶은~~제대로 된 송년회였습닏ㄱㆍ~~,"Mongryeon axe was the best gravy I've ever hadIn particular, beef brisket soybean paste stew satisfied a boyfriend with a short appetite, and herring roe rice is savory and full, but I want to keep eating itIt was a proper year-end party"

It was like an Instagram restaurant. However, it was so cold because there was no room and insulation. You handled the mistake well, but.. The restaurant doesn't taste good. The meat wasn't good and the fire was so weak that it didn't cook and it took a long time. It wasn't a place to think about with guests. I have no intention of revisiting."
639,taste,찾기편하고 분위기 좋아요 직원들 서빙도 친절하고  맛있어요. 근데 고기양이 많이 적네요^^ 배불기억거보다 한번 경험해볼만한 기회라고 생각해요. 가까우면런치세트 먹고싶어요.,"It's easy to find and the atmosphere is good.

직원분들도 신경써주시는 느낌을 받을 수 있었습니다.
고기를 구워주시는 줄 알았는데 전혀 그런 부분은 없었고 테이블 구조상 한쪽은 밑반찬을 먹기 힘든 구조입니다. 고기를 구워서 올려놓는 철판의 경우 밑 받침이 없어 기름이 그대로 바닥에 떨어지는 부분이 아쉬웠고 지저분했습니다.
불판위에 올려놓기에는 계속 아랫부분에 둔 고기가 타기 때문에 알려주신 방법은 무리가 있다 판단됩니다.
사람이 아닌 구조와 도구들의 문제를 제외하고는 회식하기에 좋은 식당입니다.","The food was clean and neat and good.. I could feel that the staff cared about me.. I thought you were going to grill meat, but there was no such thing at all, and one side of the table is difficult to eat side dishes. In the case of the iron plate where the meat is grilled and put on top, it was regrettable that the oil fell to the floor as it was because there was no base, and there was no base.. The method you told me is unreasonable because the meat at the bottom keeps burning to put it on the grill It's judged.. It's a good restaurant for company dinners except for structures and tools that are not people."
691,taste,돼지고기가 소고기만큼 맛있어요,Pork is as good as beef

695,taste,예약하고 가서 그런지 좋은 자리 주셔서 감사했어요! 구워먹는 치즈도 예약서비스로 주셨답니다. 고기를 구워주시는 줄 알았는데 구워먹는 거라 살짝 당황했지만 맛도 좋고 특히 볶음밥도 넘나 맛있었어요! 재방문 의사 있습니다!,"Thank you for giving me a good seat, maybe because I made a reservation! They also gave me grilled cheese as a reservation service. I thought they were grilling meat, but I was a little flustered because it was grilling, but the taste was good and especially the fried rice was so good! I'm willing to revisit!"
696,taste,"서비스, 공간, 맛 등등에 모두 만족했습니다.
우선 5명 회식자리여서 돼지세트 2개와 청어알볶음밥을 시켰고, 비비기 전에 미리 사진도 찍게 해주셨습니다. 
네이버 예약이어서 더덕무침도 서비스로 주셨고, 공간자체도 독립적인 공간을 예약해서 모두가 만족했습니다.

무엇보다 고기가 너무 연하고 신선해서 숯불에 금방 타지 않고 잘 익었습니다. 
같이 찍어먹는 소스며 세심한 배려가 많이 느껴져 재방문 의사가 매우 있었습니다.

다만, 수저가 조금씩 얼룩이 있어서 예민한 분들은 한마디 하실 것 같지만
저는 그냥 냅킨으로 닦고 먹었어요. 그리고 유리컵이 2개나 금이가 있어서 이런부분은 서빙전에 신경써주셨으면 합니다. 

전반적으로 가족모임, 회사모임, 친구들모임 등등 
우선적으로여기를 갈거같네요! 대만족입니다.","I was satisfied with the service, space, taste, etc.. First of all, we ordered 2 pork sets and herring roe fried rice because it was a company dinner for 5 people, and they let us take a picture before mixing it. . It was a reservation on Naver, so they gave me Deodeok seasoned chicken as a service, and everyone was satisfied with the reservation of an independent space.. . Above all, the meat was so tender and fresh that it was cooked well without burning quickly by charcoal. I was very willing to revisit it because I could feel the careful consideration of the sauce we dip together.. . However, the spoon is a little stained, so I think sensitive people will say something. I just wiped it with a napkin and ate it. And there are 2 cups of glass, so I want you to pay attention to this before serving. Overall, family gatherings, company gatherings, friends gatherings, etc. I think I will go here first! I'm very satisfied."

However, the charcoal of one of the two tables came out very late, and it took a long time to order, and there was a little inconvenience of having to check repeatedly."

When I ordered the second time, I asked to change the grill, and I spilled fish sauce on the grill in the middle, but he just left without saying sorry... Later, the person on the second floor got an apology, but throughout the company dinner, I felt like it came out too late if I ordered meat I don't know why.. The quality and taste of the meat were so good, but the expressions of the workers...Even when side dishes are placed on the table, it's set up within reach, so we just set it up and ate it..."

716,taste,"분위기 좋고 고기도 맛있었어요.
고기는 올려주기만하고 구워주지 않기 때문에 알아서 잘 구워먹어야해요.
상 구조가 다같이 반찬을 나눠먹기엔 너무 불편해요. 상 한 쪽으로만 반찬을 놓을 수 밖에 없어서 안쪽에 앉은 사람은 먹기 힘들어요.
친절함은 그냥 쏘쏘. 서빙해주시는 분들은 친절하신데 1층 관리하시는 것 같은 분은 표정부터 불친철. 처음 들어갈 때랑 먹고 나올 때 안내가 너무 불친절해서 고기가 맛있어도 두번은 안갈래요.","The atmosphere was good and the meat was delicious.. I just put the meat on top and don't grill it, so I have to grill it well on my own.. The table structure is too uncomfortable to share side dishes together. It's hard for the person sitting inside to eat because there's no choice but to put side dishes on one side.. Kindness is just so so so so. Serving people are kind, but the person who takes care of the first floor is not friendly. The guide is so unfriendly when I first go in and when I eat, so I won't go twice even if the meat is delicious."
