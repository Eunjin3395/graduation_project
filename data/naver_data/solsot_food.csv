0,taste,"갈치솥밥, 스테이크솥밥, 꼬막솥밥, 도미관자솥밥, 유린기, 새우튀김 먹었어요.
유린기와 새우튀김은 반찬으로 적절해요. 유린기는 추가로 주문하고 싶을만큼 맛있어요. 오픈런 했는데도 30분 기다려 먹었네요.
밥이 촉촉하고 맛있어서 한 그릇 뚝딱 하게 됩니다. :) 
고모가 신부전증을 앓고 계셔서 소금 빼달라고 했는데 재료 본연의 맛을 느낄 수 있는 건강한 맛이었어요. 손님 모시고 가기 좋은 식당 같아요. 외국인들이 많이 가더라고요. ","I ate hairtail pot rice, steak pot rice, cockle pot rice, sea bream pot rice, yuringi, and fried shrimp.. Yuringi and fried shrimp are suitable as side dishes. Yuringi is so delicious that I want to order extra. I waited for 30 minutes to eat even though I did open run.. The rice is moist and delicious, so you can finish a bowl quickly. :). My aunt suffered from renal failure, so I asked her to take out salt, and it was a healthy taste where I could feel the original taste of the ingredients. I think it's a good restaurant to take customers to. A lot of foreigners go there."
1,taste,"스테이크덮밥 맛있습니다. 
고기 추가 한 건데 
남자는 추가해야 양이 맞을 거 같아요. 
장어덮밥도 맛있긴한데 가격 생각하면  좀 아쉬웠습니다.
새우튀김과 유린기 무난하게 괜찮았습니다.
반찬 깔끔하고 분위기도 좋아 맛있게 잘 먹었습니다.
카프리 시켰는데 안시원해서... 이건 많이 아쉬웠습니다.","Steak over rice is good. I added meat. I think we need to add more men. Rice with grilled eel is good, but considering the price, it was a bit disappointing.. The fried shrimp and the oiler were all right.. The side dishes were clean and the atmosphere was good, so I enjoyed the meal.. I ordered a capri, but it wasn't refreshing... I was really sad about this."

After waiting for about 20 minutes, including ordering the menu, the entrance was very friendly and the taste of the food was not bad.. . I'm willing to revisit?

3,taste,"도미관자솥밥 16,000원 먹었어요!
성수다보니 가격이 저렴하진 않지만 다른 식당들 생각하면 깔끔하고 합리적이라서 방문했어요.
일단 스테이크보다 전 도미관자가 담백&고소해서 좋더라구요!
진짜 생선 좋아하시는 분들 엄청 맛있게 드실 거 같네요. 특별할 거 없어보이는데 진짜 고소+슴슴 맛나요ㅋㅋ신기해요.

추천드려요?","I ate sea bream pot rice for 16,000 won! It is not cheap because it is a holy water, but I visited it because it is neat and reasonable when I think of other restaurants.. First of all, I like the taste of sea bream more than steak because it's light and savory! I think people who really like fish will really enjoy it. It doesn't look special, but it tastes like a real savory + hedgehog. It's amazing.. If you eat it with seaweed, it's heaven...☆ I want to eat it again. There was a waiting for 11 teams because it was the weekend.. . But there was a waiting seat in front of me, so I was able to wait.(It's going to be a table.). The interior of the store was clean and nice. I made nurungji and finally yogurt service ?. It reminded me of an old jajangmyeon place, so it was a good service. I recommend it ?"

Eat well when you're full. Delicious"
5,taste,"솔솥 성수점은 처음 가봤는데 외관부터 일식당에 온 듯한 분위기와 깔끔한 내부 그리고 다양한 솥밥 메뉴가 있어 좋았어요. 저는 와규 스테이크 솥밥, 전복 솥밥 주문했는데 기본 반찬부터 김치, 씨앗 젓갈? 샐러드, 장국, 각종 소스가 자극적이지 않은 맛이어서 솥밥에 곁들어 먹기 좋았으며 솥밥 양도 푸짐하고 마지막에 누룽지까지 먹을 수 있었어요~! 스테이크도 두툼하게 들어 있는데 부드러운 식감과 담백한 맛이 일품이었어요. 전복도 큼지막하게 잘려서 들어 있는데 쫄깃하면서 탱탱한 식감이 좋았고 전체적으로 고슬고슬한 밥, 다진 쪽파, 버터, 스테이크나 전복을 비벼 먹으니 고소하면서 풍미있는 맛까지 느낄 수 있었어요. 간도 딱! 좋고 양도 푸짐하고 재료도 신선하고 마지막까지 푸짐하고 든든하게 먹었던 성수역 솥밥집이었어요","It was my first time going to the Seongsu branch of Solpot, and I liked the exterior, the atmosphere as if I was in a Japanese restaurant, the clean interior, and various pot rice menus. I ordered wagyu steak pot rice and abalone pot rice, but the basic side dishes, kimchi, salted seafood salad, long soup, and various sauces were not irritating, so it was good to eat with the pot rice, and the amount of pot rice was plentiful and I could eat nurungji at the end! Steak is also thick, and the soft texture and light taste were excellent. Abalone was also cut into large pieces, and the chewy and firm texture was good. Overall, I mixed rice, chopped chives, butter, steak or abalone, so I could taste it savory and flavorful.

맛은 있었지만 제대로 먹은건가 싶네요.
장국과 육수는 음식 세팅 시작부터
아직 안끓었다고 말씀만 하시고
솥밥에 부어먹어야할 육수는 20분이후에 나오고
심지어 1번인 저희테이블이 아니라
다른테이블 먼저 주시더라구요.
결국 장국은 구경도 못했네요 ㅎㅎㅎ
레시피가 어떤지 모르겠지만 소량 덜어서
끓여도 되지 않았을까 싶고 대처가 아쉬웠어요.
비싼 점심값을 치루고 기분 좋지 못한 식사를 했네요.","Before the opening, I entered the first line.. I guess they had high expectations because it's such a good restaurant.. It was delicious, but I wonder if you ate it properly.. Jangguk and broth from the start of setting up the food. Just say it's not boiling yet. The broth that needs to be poured into the pot rice comes out after 20 minutes. It's not our table that's number one. They gave me another table first.. After all, I couldn't even look at Jangguk. I don't know how the recipe is, but I'll take a little bit. I thought I could've cooked it, and I was disappointed with how I handled it.. You paid for a high lunch and had a bad meal."

108,taste,맛있는데 제 입맛에는 버터맛이 조금 많이 느껴졌어요. 버터 넣으면 맛있긴한데 조금 과해서 누룽지 먹을 때도 뭔가 맛이 특이해요. 지금까지 먹었던 그 깔끔한 누룽지 맛이 아니고 뭔가 아무튼 다른 맛이 되버렸어요. 솥밥 자체는 되게 정갈하고 깔끔해서 맛있게 먹었어요,"It's good, but I felt a lot of butter in my taste. It's good with butter, but it's a little too much, so it tastes unique when you eat nurungji. It didn't taste like nurungji that I ate until now, but it became a different taste. The rice itself was very neat and clean, so I ate it deliciously"
109,taste,가격대비 맛은 아쉽내요.. ㅠㅠ ; 꼬막은해감이 덜 된 것 같았어요. 모레가 씹혀서 좀.. 스테이크는 맛있엇어요.  소스도 데리야키 느낌이라 특하고! 그리고 솥밥 누룽지는 무슨 맛인지 모르겟어요 ㅠㅅ ㅠ 힝.그리고 비벼먹을 그릇 큰걸로 주세요?,"The price and taste are disappointing..

개인이 스테이크 소스로 밥 간을 맞춰서 먹어야 했는데
소스가 너무 달고 간은 슴슴했다.
나는 밥을 달게 먹는 걸 안 좋아해서 pass...
그나마 와사비를 얹어 먹으니 괜찮았다.
그래도 고기는 부드럽고 맛있었음.
다 먹은 후 테이블마다 비치된 건조 누룽지를 솥에 
불려 먹으라고 뜨거운 물도 주시는데 물이 뜨겁지가 않았는지 누룽지가 한참 동안 불지 않아서 과자처럼 먹었다. 
실망스러운 한 끼 T^T","The place where I was recklessly waiting for the wonderful interior.. I ordered steak rice because it looks like a signature.. It looks like Steki-dong by transferring it to a pot of rice ( ). I had to season the rice with the steak sauce. The sauce was too sweet and the seasoning was not enough.. I don't like sweet rice so pass... It was okay to eat it with wasabi.. But the meat was soft and delicious.. After I finished eating, I put dried nurungji on the pot. They gave me hot water to soak it, but the nurungji didn't get soggy for a long time, so I ate it like a snack. . Disappointing Meal T^T"

303,taste,"작년에 저녁 정보프로그램에서 솔솥을 첨 알았어요. 성수점은 아니었고 연남동 지점이었는데.. 방송 보는 내내 얼마나 침을 흘렸는지 몰라요. 분명 방송 탔으니 최소 6개월은 못가겠구나 했었고 이제쯤 시들해 졌겠지 하는 마음에 평일 점심시간으로 방문했는데 다행이도 대기 없이 바로 들어갔어요(테이블 세팅 시간이 조금 걸리긴 했음) 밖에서 아예 주문을 해야 테이블 안내를 해주는 형식이더라구요. 도미관자솥밥이 너무 너무 먹고 싶었는데 제가 좀.. 기대를 너무 많이 했나봐요. 살짝 비린내가 났어요. 솥밥인데 누룽지가 생기는 솥밥은 아니고 밥을 찐다음에 위에 고명(관자, 도미 등등)을 올리는 건가봐요. 테이블 한쪽 편에 누룽지가 들어있는 통이 있더라구요. 밥을 덜어서 먹고 누룽지를 넣으라는데.. 특유의 누룽지 맛이 아님","Last year, I first learned about the sol-pot in the evening information program. It wasn't Seongsu branch. It was Yeonnam-dong branch.. You don't know how much I drooled while watching the show. I thought I wouldn't be able to go for at least six months because I was on the show, but I visited during lunchtime on weekdays, and fortunately, I went in right away without waiting (although it took a little time to set the table) to order outside to guide the table. I really wanted to eat sea bream pot rice, but I.. I guess I was looking forward to it too much. It smelled a little fishy. It's a pot rice, but it's not a pot rice that produces nurungji, but it seems that you steam the rice and put garnish on it. There was a container with nurungji on one side of the table. They're telling me to put in the nurungji after eating the rice.. It doesn't taste like nurungji"
