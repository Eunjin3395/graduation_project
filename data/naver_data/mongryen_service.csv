From the time I inquired on the wire, the lady's chilly attitude was enough to be unpleasant, but after arriving, she did not accept the order for a long time, saying that she was busy responding to the table. But I thought everything would be offset if the food was delicious, but he was also mistaken. The taste of the food was okay, and the response of the server was not good.. If you're this busy, shouldn't you at least limit the number of customers or hire more servers.. Even if you leave a review like this, you will go, but I leave a review in the hope that you will think about it at least once when someone tries to visit this place."

771,service,저녁 9인 예약하고 8인이 방문했습니다. 3/3/3 자리 셋팅으로 한명이 오지않아 한 자리를 안 쓰겠다고 했습니다. 주인인지 여직원분이 룸예약은 45만원치를 먹거나 미달시 5만원 차지라고 퉁명스러운 대답. 알겠다고 했습니다. 일행이 그릇을 문의 하니 저기 셋팅 되어있다고 퉁명스러운 대답에 죄송하다고 했습니다. 근데 네이버에는 30만원치 식사 미만시 3만원 차지.. 뭐가 불만이셔서 가격을 더 높게 부르시고 그렇게 퉁명스럽게 대하셨을까요? 식사는 40만원 넘게 먹고 왔습니다. 고기 맛있고 유명한 집은 손님을 이렇게 대우해도 되나봅니다. 고기도 맛있고 친절해서 가끔 방문했는데 더 이상 그렇지 않은 것 같네요. 다음 방문은 이제 모르겠습니다. ,"I made a reservation for 9 people in the evening and 8 people visited. I said I wouldn't use one seat because one person didn't come due to the 3/3/3 digit setting. A female employee who is the owner of the room said, ""If you eat 450,000 won worth of room reservations or fail to make it, you will get 50,000 won."" I said yes. When the group inquired about the bowl, they said they were sorry for the blunt answer that it was set over there. But on Naver, if you eat less than 300,000 won, you charge 30,000 won.. What's so frustrating that you're asking for a higher price and being so blunt  I ate more than 400,000 won. I guess this is how a famous restaurant with delicious meat treats customers.

It was a busy time on Saturday, but the clerk was only there for two minutes. I understand you're busy, but..

840,service,"<리뷰 수정>

사장님 안녕하세요. 서비스를 개선하시면 좋을 것 같아서 드리는 의견이니 참고 부탁드립니다.

우선, 고기를 한창 굽는 중에 묻거나 설명 없이 숯에 주전자 물을 부으셔서 상당량의 재가 고기에 붙었고 숯에서 올라온 그을음이 고기색을 회색으로 변하게 하고 연기맛이 고기에 느껴졌습니다. 
첫번째 부으셨을 때는 그러려니 했는데 두번째도 아무말씀 없이 해주셔서 말씀 드렸던 거고, 사장님의 답변이 죄송하다거나 설명을 해주시기 보다는 '고기 다시 썰고 있어요' 라고 하신 부분이 이건 좀 아니다 싶어서 글을 남깁니다. 

이런 부분은 시정하셔서 가게 더 번창하시길 바랄게요.","<Review modification> . Hello, CEO. I think it would be good to improve the service, so please refer to this.. . First of all, a considerable amount of ash stuck to the meat by burying it or pouring water into the charcoal without explanation, and the soot from the charcoal turned the meat color into gray and the taste of smoke was felt in the meat. The first time I was swollen, I didn't say anything, but the second time, I said it without saying anything. Rather than saying sorry or explaining, I'm writing this because I don't think this is right. I hope you correct this and prosper."

The important taste of meat is. Compared to the first one, the seasoning is too strong!!! It's even more salty because I dip it in the sauce. I didn't like the original taste of axe meat. I wondered why I made the seasoning strong, so it was a meal."

It's an impeccable restaurant, but.. The only drawback is.. It's the floor of the restaurant. I don't know how you did your initial interior design.. When a person walks around, the floor vibrates.

If you eat meat at this price in Cheongdam-dong, the taste and service are kind, but Mongryeon doesn't come well even if you call it under the excuse of being busy and not enough employees, and when you serve additional orders, you throw it on the table as if you were angry, so you should understand it because you were busy. The people I went with were also upset, so I apologized for making a reservation here and had a rough dinner. I put it on the list that I should never go again. It was a dinner party where I was not satisfied with the taste, the price, and the service."

1. 맛이없다. 가격값 절대 못합니다.
    도끼살, 항정살, 목살, 뒷덜미살 먹었습니다.
    이 돈으로 딴 거 먹는게 낫고, 항정살
    뒷덜미살은 진짜 최악입니다.  제대로 썰지도 
    않아서 다 붙어있습니다.
    전반적으로 고무줄같이 질기고 뭔맛인지
    모르겠습니다. 근처 금돼지나 땅코랑 정말 
    비교 됩니다. 

2. 위생. 요즘 시대에 큐알체크도 안해서 좀 
    당황했습니다. 역시나 고기에 머리카락 붙여
    서 가져다 주셨는데, 미안하다는 말도 없어요

3. 서비스. 친절하다 그래서 갔는데, 사람이 
    바뀐건지, 초심을 잃은 건지 기본도 못해요.
    굽는 것도 셀프고 갈 이유가 없네요. 

분위기때문에 기대했다가 잡쳤어요","I just eat it, but I really don't show it... 1. It doesn't taste good. I can't afford the price at all..     I ate axe meat, pork neck meat, and back meat..     It's better to eat something else with this money, pork neck. The backside is the worst.  I didn't cut it properly, so it's all stuck together..     Overall, it's tough like a rubber band and what it tastes like.     I don't know. Compared to the golden pig or the dank nose. 2. Hygiene. I'm a little flustered because I don't even check QR these days. Stick your hair on the meat.     They brought it to me, but they didn't say sorry. . 3. Service. I heard it was kind, so I went there.     I don't know if it's changed or lost its original intention..     There's no reason to grill it myself.

It was disappointing in many ways. Compared to the price, there was little care from the staff, and the ax meat tasted just like that compared to the big expectations.. Beef brisket doenjang was good to eat. In the 3 additional sets of Jeju pigs ordered, hair came out and was bitten right away, and the cutting condition of the new meat did not look very good. Pork neck was more than enough to eat, and the back of the pork neck was.. It tasted like I didn't know what I was eating. The first charcoal is enough to eat just one axe, but if I order more, I should add more charcoal.. I didn't change the board on my own, and I was embarrassed to keep calling the staff..

","Ax meat! It's good. I went to lunch and ordered axe meat less than 1:30 p.m., but the person serving said that I should go out at 3 p.m. because the meat order is only until 2 p.m. and it's break time from 3 p.m. if I don't go out at 3 p.m., I don't want to eat it. It was unpleasant. The staff ate from 2 o'clock... It was ""Left Anxiety If you're going to do this, you'll have to break time from 2pm.

질겨졌고 후식은 전체적으로 단맛이 강해지고 텁텁한게 msg를 더 많이 쓰는거같습니다.  처음갓을때의 감동은 아무데서도 느낄수 없었네요. 집앞이라 정말 애정하던 곳인데 다시는 안갈겁니다.","I went four times before this visit. I always thought the service was good, the taste was good, and the quality of the meat was high, but this visit was really disappointing. In the meantime, you've become more popular, but you seem to have lost your original intention. The part-timers are unkind. They used to take care of me grilling meat, but they don't come even if I call them. Unlike before, the axe meat is cut roughly according to the scissors, and the juice decreases regardless of beef and pork. It's tough, and the dessert overall has a stronger sweetness, and I think I use msg more when it's dry.  I couldn't feel the emotion when I first started. It's a place I really loved because it's in front of my house, but I'm never going to go again."

It's one of the restaurants where I'm really satisfied when I take my acquaintances with me Mongryeon... I don't know if it's black pig hair or hair between the meat yesterday, but there was a short foreign substance between the sides of the fan, so I told the staff who brought me charcoal with a hat on the first floor.. That's how it's supposed to be... I saw it for the first time when I went to Mongryeon, where the fur was stuck on the meat.. It's not embedded... It was very unpleasant. I think it's a restaurant that has a luxurious image Mongryeon...

The taste... I think it would be much better to go to a regular pork chain. The table for four people is really small.

한가지 아쉬운 점은 네이버 예약 시, 제공된다는 서비스는 제공받지 못하였네요^^;; 깜빡하고 못챙기신거 같습니다. 사실 해당 예약할때는 이벤트를 몰랐는데 메뉴판에 적혀있어서 알았어요;; 저희가 먼저 요청할 수도 있었지만 서비스 개념이다보니 따로 요청드리지는 않고 퇴점하면서 사장님께만 말씀드렸습니다.
맛있게 잘 먹었습니다~","The meat and basic side dishes were delicious, and the fried rice and cold noodles were also very delicious.

The service of the staff wasn't bad considering the characteristics of the meat restaurant It felt just right Haha.

도끼살 너무 맛있어용",They gave me a good seat and I'm very satisfied with the service. The ax meat is so good
984,service,"3번째 방문, 예약 프로세스도 좋고 직원분들도 친절하시고 음식은 더 맛있었습니다. ^^","""Third visit, the reservation process was good, the staff were kind, and the food was more delicious."" ^^"
985,service,고기도 맛있고 직원분들도 친절하세요! 무엇보다 식기들이 예뻐서 누굴 데려가도 좋을 것 같아요~,"The meat is delicious and the staff are kind! Above all, the dishes are pretty, so I think it'd be good to take someone"
986,service,"2층 춥다고 안내해주셔서 1층에서 먹었어요
바쁜 점심시간에 방문했지만, 
금방 금방 주문이 잘 나와서 좋았습니다.","They told me that it was cold on the second floor, so I ate it on the first floor. Although I visited during the busy lunch time. It was good that the order came out quickly."
987,service,가격대비 서비스나 청결도는 그냥 그렇습니다. 고기맛은 좋으나 직접 구워먹어야해서 불조절도 어렵고 굽기 바쁘네요. 양파나 파절임 밑반찬은 먹기위해 자를필요가 있는데 그런 서브가 없어 아쉽습니다.,"The service and cleanliness for the price is just so-so. The meat tastes good, but it's hard to control the heat because you have to grill it yourself and you're busy grilling it. I need to cut onions or side dishes with green onion pickles to eat, but it's a shame that there's no such serve."
988,service,"고기 구성이나 맛은 좋았으나..
고기나 기타 메뉴(주류 포함) 들이 너무 늦게 나옵니다.. 두세번 말해야 그제서야 갖다주시고 해서 직접 가져다 먹었습니다..
고기는 주말이라 오래걸린다는 말만 하시고..
직원을 전반적으로 늘리시는게 서비스 측면에서 낫지 않을까합니다.
서빙하시는 아주머니는 친절하셔서 좋았습니다.","The composition and taste of the meat were good, but... Meat and other menus (including alcoholic beverages) are served too late.. I had to say it a couple of times before they brought it to me, so I brought it myself and ate it... You only say that meat takes a long time because it's the weekend... I think it would be better to increase the number of employees overall in terms of service.. It was nice that the lady serving was kind."
989,service,친절하고 깔끔합니다,Kind and neat
990,service,"음식은 깔끔하고 정갈하고 좋았습니다.
직원분들도 신경써주시는 느낌을 받을 수 있었습니다.
고기를 구워주시는 줄 알았는데 전혀 그런 부분은 없었고 테이블 구조상 한쪽은 밑반찬을 먹기 힘든 구조입니다. 고기를 구워서 올려놓는 철판의 경우 밑 받침이 없어 기름이 그대로 바닥에 떨어지는 부분이 아쉬웠고 지저분했습니다.
불판위에 올려놓기에는 계속 아랫부분에 둔 고기가 타기 때문에 알려주신 방법은 무리가 있다 판단됩니다.
사람이 아닌 구조와 도구들의 문제를 제외하고는 회식하기에 좋은 식당입니다.","The food was clean and neat and good.. I could feel that the staff cared about me.. I thought you were going to grill meat, but there was no such thing at all, and one side of the table is difficult to eat side dishes. In the case of the iron plate where the meat is grilled and put on top, it was regrettable that the oil fell to the floor as it was because there was no base, and there was no base.. The method you told me is unreasonable because the meat at the bottom keeps burning to put it on the grill It's judged.. It's a good restaurant for company dinners except for structures and tools that are not people."
991,service,"서비스, 공간, 맛 등등에 모두 만족했습니다.
우선 5명 회식자리여서 돼지세트 2개와 청어알볶음밥을 시켰고, 비비기 전에 미리 사진도 찍게 해주셨습니다. 
네이버 예약이어서 더덕무침도 서비스로 주셨고, 공간자체도 독립적인 공간을 예약해서 모두가 만족했습니다.

무엇보다 고기가 너무 연하고 신선해서 숯불에 금방 타지 않고 잘 익었습니다. 
같이 찍어먹는 소스며 세심한 배려가 많이 느껴져 재방문 의사가 매우 있었습니다.

다만, 수저가 조금씩 얼룩이 있어서 예민한 분들은 한마디 하실 것 같지만
저는 그냥 냅킨으로 닦고 먹었어요. 그리고 유리컵이 2개나 금이가 있어서 이런부분은 서빙전에 신경써주셨으면 합니다. 

전반적으로 가족모임, 회사모임, 친구들모임 등등 
우선적으로여기를 갈거같네요! 대만족입니다.","I was satisfied with the service, space, taste, etc.. First of all, we ordered 2 pork sets and herring roe fried rice because it was a company dinner for 5 people, and they let us take a picture before mixing it. . It was a reservation on Naver, so they gave me Deodeok seasoned chicken as a service, and everyone was satisfied with the reservation of an independent space.. . Above all, the meat was so tender and fresh that it was cooked well without burning quickly by charcoal. I was very willing to revisit it because I could feel the careful consideration of the sauce we dip together.. . However, the spoon is a little stained, so I think sensitive people will say something. I just wiped it with a napkin and ate it. And there are 2 cups of glass, so I want you to pay attention to this before serving. Overall, family gatherings, company gatherings, friends gatherings, etc. I think I will go here first! I'm very satisfied."
992,service,분위기 굿 고기 퀄리티 굿. 육회랑 제주오겹살 맛있어요. 가격은 약간의 분위기값 포함. 차돌된장찌게 서비스로 주셔서 감사합니다 ^^ 오랜만에 만난 친구들과 즐거운 시간 보냈어요 ~,The atmosphere is good. The quality of the meat is good. Beef tartare and Jeju pork belly are good. The price includes some atmospheric value. Thank you for the beef brisket jangjigae ^^ I had a great time with my friends ~
993,service,아주. 친절하시고.테이블셋팅이. 너무. 예쁘네요.고깃집이. 아니고. 카페에서. 스테이크먹는. 느낌이었어요^^,"He's very kind.The table setting is so. It's pretty. At a barbecue place. No, at a cafe. Eating steak. It felt like that. ^^"
994,service,서비스 좋고 음식도 맛있었습니다.,The service was good and the food was delicious.
995,service,고깃집아니고 레스토랑인줄 알았네요 ㅎㅎ.. 고깃집의 연기 가득한 분위기는 상상했다면 노~노~ 직원들 서비스도 만족스럽고 음식하나하나도 정성이 느껴지네요~모임이나 가족식사 추천해요~^^,"I thought it was a restaurant, not a meat restaurant.. If you imagined the smoke-filled atmosphere of the meat restaurant, no, no. The service of the staff was satisfactory and I could feel the sincerity of each foodI recommend a family meal or a gathering^^"
996,service,"맛있고 분위기도 좋고 친절하셨어요..
다만 네이버예약손님인걸 깜빡하셔서 치즈구이는 못먹었습니다ㅠㅠ 죄송하다고 대신이라고 탄산음료 주셨어요..ㅎㅎ",It was delicious and the atmosphere was nice and kind... But I couldn't eat grilled cheese because I forgot that I was a reservation customer for NaverHe gave me a soda to say sorry instead..Haha
997,service,"분위기 좋고 고기도 맛있었어요.
고기는 올려주기만하고 구워주지 않기 때문에 알아서 잘 구워먹어야해요.
상 구조가 다같이 반찬을 나눠먹기엔 너무 불편해요. 상 한 쪽으로만 반찬을 놓을 수 밖에 없어서 안쪽에 앉은 사람은 먹기 힘들어요.
친절함은 그냥 쏘쏘. 서빙해주시는 분들은 친절하신데 1층 관리하시는 것 같은 분은 표정부터 불친철. 처음 들어갈 때랑 먹고 나올 때 안내가 너무 불친절해서 고기가 맛있어도 두번은 안갈래요.","The atmosphere was good and the meat was delicious.. I just put the meat on top and don't grill it, so I have to grill it well on my own.. The table structure is too uncomfortable to share side dishes together. It's hard for the person sitting inside to eat because there's no choice but to put side dishes on one side.. Kindness is just so so so so. Serving people are kind, but the person who takes care of the first floor is not friendly. The guide is so unfriendly when I first go in and when I eat, so I won't go twice even if the meat is delicious."
998,service,직원분들 친절하고 음식 맛 좋습니다 b,Staff members are kind and the food tastes good b

다음번에 또 가기로했습니다","It's so delicious. I made a reservation and they prepared a window seat on their own. The beer was good, too. The interior of the store was very clean. The staff are kind, too. We're going to go again next time"
1002,service,정말 만족했어요 몽련도끼살에 오겹살 2인분 먹고 냉면까지 먹으니 좀 비쌌지만 값이 아깝지 않을 만큼 질도 좋고 서비스도 좋았습니다 다음에도 방문할게요!,"I was really satisfied It was a little expensive to eat two servings of five-pork belly and cold noodles, but the quality was good enough and the service was good I'll visit again next time!"
1003,service,서비스며 맛이며 다 좋았습니다^^ 다음번에도 재방문 하려구요,The service and the taste were all good^^ I'm going to visit again next time
1004,service,"서비스도 좋았지만 고기맛과 분기위도 너무 좋았습니다^^
밑반찬도 많이 생각하신 느낌이고 수제맥주가 참 맛나네요^^ 
앞으로 더 번창하시기 바랍니다.","The service was good, but the taste of meat and quarter was really good^^. It feels like you've thought of side dishes and handmade beer is really^^ I wish you all the best in the future."
1005,service,"분위기도 좋고 직원분들 너무 친절하십니다!!
고기도 너무 맛있어요~!!ㅎ","The atmosphere is good and the staff are so kind! The meat is so good, too!!Hah!"
1006,service,"가족 저녁 식사로 첫 방문이었는데 너무 좋았습니다.
각 부위마다 고기가 너무 맛있었고 내부 인테리어도 너무 좋았습니다

제일 좋았던 건 근무하시는 분들의 서비스 마인드가 프로였습니다.
어딜가면 부모님 특유의 빨리빨리와 짓궂은 말투때문에 좀 민망했는데
근무하시는 분들이 너무 부드럽고 프로답게 대처해주시는 모습에
고기 맛이 더 좋았던 것 같아요.

기분 좋은 가족 저녁식사 시간 만들어 주셔서 감사합니다.","It was my first visit to my family for dinner and it was so nice.. The meat in each part was very delicious and the interior was very good. The best thing was the service mind of the workers was professional.. Whenever I went somewhere, I was embarrassed because of my parents' fast and mischievous way of speaking. The staff members are so soft and professional. I think the meat tasted better... Thank you for making a pleasant family dinner time."
1007,service,직원분(서빙담당분) 친절하시고 고기맛과 분위기 다 좋았어요~ㅎㅎ,The staff (serving staff) was kind and the meat taste and atmosphere were all goodHaha

1009,service,"고기도 맛있고 직원분들도 엄청 친절하시네요. 하나 아쉬운 점은 고기 주문했을때 시간이 좀 오래걸리는 점이랑, 숯불에 기름이 떨어져 연기가 많이 났어요. 아무튼 다시 가고 싶은 집이네요.^^","The meat is good and the staff are very kind. One thing I regret is that it takes a long time to order meat, and there was a lot of smoke because the charcoal fire ran out of oil. Anyway, it's a house I want to go back to.^^"
