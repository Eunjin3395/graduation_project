직원분들도 친절하시고 맛있어서 기분좋게 식사했습니다??","It's a basic jjamppong, but it's a lot, so you can eat it full every time you go!!Octopus jjamppong is really delicious because it's full of octopus and chewy I'll eat it again next time. . The staff were kind and delicious, so I had a great meal??"
386,service,갈비 짬뽕이 시그니처라고 해서 주문해 봤어요 ㅎㅎ처음 먹어보는 갈비짬뽕인데 국물도 진해서 그런지 진짜 맛있더라구요?? 갈비도 큼직하고 양도 너무 많아서 남겼어요 ㅜㅡ 탕수육도 쫀떡하고 튀김옷이 두껍지 않아서 저한테는 맛있게 먹었어요 ~~~~ㅎㅎ  사장님도 엄청 친절하세요 재방문 무조건 추천이에여! ,"Galbi jjamppong is the signature dish, so I ordered it It's my first time eating galbi jjamppong, but it was really delicious because the soup was thick?? I left it because the ribs were big and the amount was too much The tangsuyuk was chewy and the batter wasn't thick, so I ate it deliciously The boss is very kind, too It's definitely recommended to revisit!"
387,service,직원들 불친절함,the unkindness of the staff

등갈비 짬뽕도 양도 많고 너무 맛있습니다
중식은 수타원이 진리!!!",Give me noodles for jajang rice. Boiled dumplings for free. Sweet and sour pork is so good. Back ribs jjamppong is also very delicious with a lot of portions. Hand ovals are the best when it comes to Chinese food!!!
390,service,"음식맛도 좋고 서비스도 좋네요.
탕수육엔 물만두 서비스가 있네요.
음식은 2개 시켰는데 서비스로 탁자가 꽉차네요~ ㅎㅎ
옛날 볶음밥엔 면이 조금 제공이 되어서 볶음밥 소스에 비며 먹으면 짜장면을 조금 먹을수있고, 따라오는 짬뽕국물에 넣어서 먹으면 짬뽕면을 먹을수 있더라구요~ㅎㅎ
면이 한젖가락 나오는데 작은행복이 +1되네요.
","The food tastes good and the service is good.. There is boiled dumpling service in Tangsuyuk.. I ordered 2 dishes, but the table is full for free. In the past, fried rice provided some noodles, so if you eat it empty in the fried rice sauce, you can eat a little bit of jjamppong, and if you put it in the soup that comes with it, you can eat jjamppong noodles~LOL. A small amount of happiness comes out with a spoonful of noodles.."
391,service,"짜장면이  생각나서찾았는데 역시 맛있네요
서비스 좋고 친절하시고  잘먹고 갑니다

393,service,"1.2만 해물짬뽕 먹었는데 해물이 전혀 신선하지 않음 해물짬뽕은 다른데서 먹는게 좋을듯 싶음 별로임
맛도 그냥 동네가게 수준 찾아와서 먹을만큼은 절대 아님 그닥 친절하지도 않음 가격만 비쌈 ","I ate 1.2 million seafood jjamppong, but the seafood is not fresh at all. I don't like seafood jjamppong because I think it would be better to eat it somewhere else. The taste is just like a local store, and it's not even very friendly. It's expensive"
394,service,"가격에 비해 양이 적어서 아쉽습니다.
짬뽕국물은 자극적이지 않고 삼삼한 맛입니당.
직원분들이 전체적으로 친절해요!",It's a shame that the amount is small compared to the price.. Jjamppong soup is not irritating and has a strong taste.. The staff are all very kind!

리뷰보고가는데 실망입니다 그리고 
주차담당분 완전매너 없네요 


","It's too small for the price of the tangsuyuk filling ㅠㅠ?????. I'm looking forward to the review of Galbi Jjamppong. I don't like the taste because it's too small. Tray jajangmyeon. Compared to the price of tray jajangmyeon in other places, there's not much seafood It's good to eat Chapagetti. I'm disappointed when I read the reviews And the parking manager is completely out of manners."

짜장면도 그냥똑같은맛 단지 수타면이라는거만빼면 똑같네요 가게도 난방을 안해서 직원들이 껴입고다니고 아무튼 실망입니다 다시갈일없네요","It's so different from 2 years ago and now I was eating beef ribs jjamppong, but it was cold, and it was not delicious compared to the price, and I almost broke my teeth because I was hungry, but I can't say that I ate it well. Ribs smell like pork and they just sell it with regular jjamppong. Jajangmyeon has the same taste except for handmade noodles The store doesn't heat up either, so the employees wear it in layers, so I'm disappointed I don't have to go back"
400,service,"삼선짜장면은 맛있었는데 해물짬뽕은 너무 별로예요 맛이 차돌맛도 느껴지고 개운한맛도 안느껴지고 느끼했어요 짬뽕이 느끼한건 첨이라 당황스럽네요
거기다 군만두 주문했는데 반찬 가지러간 사이 저희보다 늦게왔던 손님한테 먼저 군만두가 가있더라구요 그래서 주문 취소하고 계산할때 카운터에 계신분께 말씀 드리니 어머나~이렇게 놀라시고는 죄송하다는 말씀이 없더라구요 이건 뭐 그럴수 있다치는데 진짜 기분나빴던건 음식 먹고있는데 분홍티 입은 직원분이 저희 테이블에 뭘 탁 놓고 어떠한 설명도 없이 도망치듯이 가시더라구요 그래서 같이간 일행과  이거 뭐지? 서로 말하다가 다른 직원분께 물어보니 후식으로 드리는 맛탕이라고 하시더라구요  아니 후식으로 주는거면 설명을 해주고 가던가 . ..참 기분 나빴어요","Samseon jjajangmyeon was good, but seafood jjamppong wasn't good. It tasted like beef brisket and didn't taste refreshing. It was greasy I'm flustered because it's the first time that jjamppong is greasy. And I ordered fried dumplings, but while I was picking up the side dishes, the customer who came later than us had fried dumplings first So when I canceled my order and paid, I told the person at the counter, and they were so surprised that I didn't say sorry It's possible, but what was really upsetting was that I was eating, and the employee in the pink shirt put something on our table and ran away without any explanation So I was talking to the group I went with, and when I asked the other staff, they said it was mattang for dessert  No, if it's for dessert, you should've explained it before you should've gone..I was so upset"

The jjamppong was not spicy at all, so even those who couldn't eat spicy food could eat it without any burden!! There's a mini version for tangsuyuk I don't think there's a big difference between a mini and a small size The sauce was sweet and salty with soy sauce and fruit!!
