It looks thick and fatless like steak, but it boasts an incredibly soft texture. Perhaps the shoulder rack is such a delicious part, but the fat attached to some pieces is also one of the charms of axe meat. I don't know why the free stew is so delicious. There's meat in it, so I wonder if I can eat this for free. Another strength of Mongryeon is dessert. Binaeng is 7,000 won, which feels a little expensive for dessert, but if you take a bite of it, you can eat it happily, let alone think of money.
