Perhaps the shoulder rack is such a delicious part, but the fat attached to some pieces is also one of the charms of axe meat. I don't know why the free stew is so delicious.

Binaeng is 7,000 won, which feels a little expensive for dessert, but if you take a bite of it, you can eat it happily, let alone think of money.

I looked at other customers with that expression. It was so embarrassing. It felt dirty in the sky while eating happily  I don't think I'll ever go again\n",
