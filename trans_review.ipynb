      "1 : Black Bean Noodles taste normal but have a lot. Sirloin tangsuyuk is delicious without the smell of meat.. We don't have enough sauce for jajangmyeon, but they give us more if you request.. And I think galbi jjamppong has two large ribs, so I think it's cost-effective!\n",
      "2 : If you take a bite of fried dumplings, you can feel the juiciness. It's seasoned enough, so you don't have to dip it in soy sauce. Octopus jjamppong's octopus is very chewy.. The parking lot attached to the building is too small, so you have to use the parking lot that is a little far away.\n",
      "3 : It's a basic jjamppong, but it's a lot, so you can eat it full every time you go!!Octopus jjamppong is really delicious because it's full of octopus and chewy I'll eat it again next time. . The staff were kind and delicious, so I had a great meal👍👍\n",
      "4 : Octopus jjamppong, sweet and sour pork strongly recommended. The soup is refreshing, so it's delicious. There's a lot! I'm satisfied because it feels like I added a lot of ingredients\n",
      "5 : Galbi jjamppong is the signature dish, so I ordered it It's my first time eating galbi jjamppong, but it was really delicious because the soup was thick👍🏻 I left it because the ribs were big and the amount was too much The tangsuyuk was chewy and the batter wasn't thick, so I ate it deliciously The boss is very kind, too It's definitely recommended to revisit!\n",
      "6 : It's a popular restaurant. It's a 24-hour Chinese restaurant. I am very satisfied with the price, taste, and amount\n",
      "7 : It's a lot and it's good ~~\n",
      "8 : There's a lot of beef ribs and jjamppong. Samseon jajangmyeon is a bit salty.. I'm glad I didn't order tangsuyuk because it was a lot\n",
      "9 : Seafood jjamppong and jajangmyeon are all delicious because they are handmade noodles that I cooked several times. It has a lot of seafood such as abalone and mussel, and it's moderately spicy. Especially, handmade dumplings were so good\n",
      "10 : I really enjoyed the meal.\n",
      "11 : I heard it's good, so I looked for it. The rich taste of the soup is excellent ♡. Sweet and sour pork is chewy, too. I'm going to enjoy jajangmyeon with my family.\n",
      "12 : I ordered beef ribs jjamppong, white jjamppong, and tangsuyuk and they were all delicious. There are a lot of beef ribs and the soup tastes like a thick broth. Baek Jjamppong has a clean taste that is not irritating. Everything was delicious\n",
      "13 : They said they would make a new tray jajangmyeon because it was too salty, but they decided to eat it because three people were two people. Later, they added additional noodles, but they ate a little bit because it was salty\n",
      "14 : Boss, the bowl for warm food is too cold.. It was like that when I was cold, but it's delicious, but it's a small bowl that can be more delicious..\n",
      "15 : I went to see a piece of beef ribs jjamppong. Not just jjamppong, but tangsuyuk and fried rice are all good남편 My husband is asking me to go again\n",
      "16 : Personally, hand-made dumplings were oily and bad\n",
      "17 : Jjajang gop is a lot and Tangsuyuk mini is a lot.. The taste is not bad.. Please park with a valet at the back of the store building. The parking lot is not big. Looks like there's a separate parking lot nearby.\n",
      "18 : It's nice to have warm barley tea because it's winter. I ate jjamppong rice and jajangmyeon today, but it was a shame that the noodles were slightly swollen. It's good to give dessert, too^^\n",
      "19 : It's known as a good restaurant, so I'll stop by... Wow, it's delicious!!!The taste of jjamppong and crunchy tangsuyuk that I ate when I was young are soft and fresh. I really enjoyed the meal. ^^\n",
      "20 : I brought Samseon Black Bean Noodles, Jjamppong, and Mini Sweet and Sour Pork for lunch on the weekend. The taste of jjamppong is slightly different from day to day. This time, the existing beef bone broth is so small that it hardly tastes like it, and the spicy taste has become stronger.\n",
      "21 : It's a place that appeared on various broadcasts as beef ribs jjamppong, but I actually ate oyster jjamppong (white). It was delicious. It was good because there was a lot of oysters compared to 11,000 won. Looking at the amount of oysters alone, I don't think it's comparable to other places. However, it was a shame that the oysters were not very fresh. Maybe that's why, the taste of the soup was murky. But it was delicious, and even though it's white broth, it's a spicy taste that reminds you of course. Oh, parking is not enough space, so you have to go to the nearby villa.\n",
      "22 : The soup tastes good\n",
      "23 : I heard it came out on TV, and I went there when I grew up, but Mianbao Xia regretted it.. The other food was good and there was a lot. But. Galbi jjamppong is very cheesy. I wish it was hotter\n",
      "24 : I couldn't eat any of the squid in jjamppong because it was too tough. And the amount of jajangmyeon was not enough compared to the noodles\n",
      "25 : I enjoyed the meal.\n",
      "26 : We ate jajangmyeon together. It was so good!\n",
      "27 : The tangsuyuk is thick with meat, and the fries are thin and crispy, and it doesn't smell bad, so it's delicious!\n",
      "28 : It's really good\n",
      "29 : Sweet and sour pork is good\n",
      "30 : The jjamppong noodles I ordered at the door are soggy, and I can smell when the ribs were cooked. Oyster jjamppong rice doesn't have any ingredients, so if you use rice. Will it come out like this Don't ever go\n",
      "31 : It's delicious. I'll be back\n",
      "32 : Give me noodles for jajang rice. Boiled dumplings for free. Sweet and sour pork is so good. Back ribs jjamppong is also very delicious with a lot of portions. Hand ovals are the best when it comes to Chinese food!!!\n",
      "33 : The food tastes good and the service is good.. There is boiled dumpling service in Tangsuyuk.. I ordered 2 dishes, but the table is full for free. In the past, fried rice provided some noodles, so if you eat it empty in the fried rice sauce, you can eat a little bit of jjamppong, and if you put it in the soup that comes with it, you can eat jjamppong noodles~LOL. A small amount of happiness comes out with a spoonful of noodles..\n",
      "34 : It's good\n",
      "35 : Jjamppong Sweet and Sour Pork Restaurant :)\n",

      "38 : It's delicious. Jjambbo\n",
      "39 : It was hard to find a good place for jjamppong, but this place is rich in seafood and the soup tastes clean. Please try it^^\n",
      "40 : Jjamppong is the best\n",
      "41 : Seafood jjamppong is good and good\n",
      "42 : Black Bean Noodles are delicious\n",
      "43 : The jajangmyeon is spicy.  It was cute because there was a serving robot. Parking was hard\n",
      "44 : I don't have any pictures because I'm just eating, but my parents used to say it was delicious when I was young, and I ate it often with them, but I still came because it was delicious, so I started to come often with my boyfriend these days Haha. We love each other's noodles, but there's no other restaurant that's clean and delicious like this. It's the best restaurant❤️ I'll come often to eat ice cream after eatingOh ✌️\n",
      "45 : It's delicious, but it's so cold that I might get indigestion...\n",

      "47 : I ate Samseon Jjajang Galbi Jjambbong Kkanpunggi.. It's the worst. Eat it with jajangmyeon and jjamppong..I play separately with noodles and soup and jajang sauce The noodles are too boiled. It's the worst I don't know if it came out like this, but it's the worst I threw away 50,000 won I should've just bought Chapagetti for 1,200 won at a convenience store. I hope no one gets hurt.\n",
      "48 : It's delicious\n",
      "49 : It's good, but I think the amount of sweet and sour pork is not enough\n",
      "50 : The jajangmyeon here is the best\n",
      "51 : It's good. It's fresh and Samseon is much better than basic black bean noodles. Jjamppong broth is strong, too It's a bit salty, but it's good to season it with hot tea\n",
      "52 : He is kind and the food is clean and delicious\n",
      "53 : It was delicious\n",
      "54 : I've been a regular since I went there once. Jjamppong, old fried rice, and sweet and sour pork are so good.. I'm going to eat other things one by one\n",
      "55 : It's just enough and delicious. However, the onions in jjajang and jjamppong were too lumpy to suit my taste.\n",
      "56 : The food is delicious\n",
      "57 : It tastes so, so, so good!!!It's good. It's a good restaurant!!!\n",

      "60 : I love the taste of jjamppong\n",
      "61 : Jjamppong is really good. It has a lot of ingredients and the base is meat broth, so it's very catchy. . Tangsuyuk is also good because the meat is thick\n",
      "62 : It's been a while since I ate jjajang and jjamppong tangsuyuk in Sutamyeon, so I feel great. I really enjoyed the meal.\n",
      "63 : The soup is not stimulating, but it's not fresh whether it's mussel or clam. Fried dumplings are a bit greasy\n",
      "64 : Beef ribs are not warm and the beef ribs are cold, and the noodles are not elastic and the soup of horned noodles is salty. The amount is average\n",
      "65 : Seafood jjamppong is delicious and mini sweet and sour pork is delicious, but mini sweet and sour pork seems to have less medicine than I thought. ᆢYou can park only two or three cars next to the store, so you have to park somewhere else and walk  The food is delicious\n",
      "66 : It's good\n",
      "67 : It's good. Fire taste. Jjamppong soup..And soft sweet and sour pork\n",
      "68 : It's good\n",
      "69 : It's good!!\n",

Ribs smell like pork and they just sell it with regular jjamppong. Jajangmyeon has the same taste except for handmade noodles The store doesn't heat up either, so the employees wear it in layers, so I'm disappointed I don't have to go back\n",

And I ordered fried dumplings, but while I was picking up the side dishes, the customer who came later than us had fried dumplings first So when I canceled my order and paid, I told the person at the counter, and they were so surprised that I didn't say sorry It's possible, but what was really upsetting was that I was eating, and the employee in the pink shirt put something on our table and ran away without any explanation So I was talking to the group I went with, and when I asked the other staff, they said it was mattang for dessert  No, if it's for dessert, you should've explained it before you should've gone..I was so upset\n",

Jjamppong jjajang is good, but the service is not good. 5 stars ^^\n",

      "360 : This is a jajangmyeon restaurant recommended by local residents. Since it's handmade noodles, the thickness is not constant, but it's very chewy. Jajangmyeon and jjamppong were all good. During lunchtime on weekdays, rice is provided free of charge, and parking was possible for about 3 cars next to the store. There's a big room on the second floor, so it looks good as a dining room\n",

      "391 : The food tastes good and the service is good.. There is boiled dumpling service in Tangsuyuk.. I ordered 2 dishes, but the table is full for free. In the past, fried rice provided some noodles, so if you eat it empty in the fried rice sauce, you can eat a little bit of jjamppong, and if you put it in the soup that comes with it, you can eat jjamppong noodles~LOL. A small amount of happiness comes out with a spoonful of noodles..\n",

      "396 : He is kind and the food is clean and delicious\n",
      "397 : It's too small for the price of the tangsuyuk filling ㅠㅠ갈비. I'm looking forward to the review of Galbi Jjamppong. I don't like the taste because it's too small. Tray jajangmyeon. Compared to the price of tray jajangmyeon in other places, there's not much seafood It's good to eat Chapagetti.

Ribs smell like pork and they just sell it with regular jjamppong. Jajangmyeon has the same taste except for handmade noodles The store doesn't heat up either, so the employees wear it in layers, so I'm disappointed I don't have to go back\n",
      "401 : Samseon jjajangmyeon was good, but seafood jjamppong wasn't good. It tasted like beef brisket and didn't taste refreshing. It was greasy I'm flustered because it's the first time that jjamppong is greasy. And I ordered fried dumplings, but while I was picking up the side dishes, the customer who came later than us had fried dumplings first So when I canceled my order and paid, I told the person at the counter, and they were so surprised that I didn't say sorry It's possible, but what was really upsetting was that I was eating, and the employee in the pink shirt put something on our table and ran away without any explanation So I was talking to the group I went with, and when I asked the other staff, they said it was mattang for dessert  No, if it's for dessert, you should've explained it before you should've gone..I was so upset\n",

      "403 : Tangsuyuk is really good!! I think I will go there often because it is clean and the service is good\n",
      "404 : I wanted to eat something simple, so I ate it. The owner is kind and it's really good!\n",
      "405 : It's kind and delicious\n",
      "406 : It was good, but it wasn't enough And I was going to participate in the SNS event, but they said no because I didn't tell them in advance. Other reviews said I could do it when I paid without telling them in advance... And it's not written in the event description, and I won't go again. The service is not good\n",
      "407 : I ordered crab meat fried rice set 1 to enjoy it, and I was waiting for more than 10 minutes, and they said no crab meat and changed it to shrimp fried rice without an apology, but I canceled it because it wasn't in good condition, but it wasn't that bad. Jjamppong jjajang is good, but the service is not good. 5 stars ^^\n",

      "411 : Bad service...The taste... It's just...I don't recommend it\n",
      "412 : It was the best Chinese restaurant I had recently! The staff were so kind and nice, but some of the staff didn't wear a mask or chin-sk, so I think we need to improve it! The taste is the best!\n",
      "413 : It's nice of you to be kindThe food is delicious, too!\n",
      "414 : I couldn't even take a picture because I was busy eating손님 Even if there were many customers, it was even better because they were so kind!!\n",

There's a mini version for tangsuyuk I don't think there's a big difference between a mini and a small size The sauce was sweet and salty with soy sauce and fruit!!
